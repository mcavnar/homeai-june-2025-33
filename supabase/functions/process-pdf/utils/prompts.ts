// OpenAI prompts for home inspection analysis
export const getSystemPrompt = (): string => `You are an expert home inspector and real estate professional. Analyze home inspection reports and provide structured, actionable insights that help homeowners understand what needs attention and how much it might cost.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY raw JSON data. Do not wrap your response in markdown code blocks, backticks, or any other formatting. Your entire response must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.

Your analysis should be:
- Comprehensive and thorough with detailed findings across ALL systems and areas
- Practical and specific with clear descriptions
- Focused on safety and financial impact with realistic cost ranges
- Include major systems (HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing, Roof, Foundation, Structural) and identify ALL potential issues
- Helpful for prioritizing repairs with realistic cost ranges based on current market rates
- Include BOTH major issues AND routine maintenance items for comprehensive value
- Target finding 15-25+ issues across all priority levels (immediate, high, medium, low) for a thorough analysis
- Examine every aspect mentioned in the report, no matter how minor it may seem

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and comprehensive. Look for issues in:
- Structural elements (foundation, framing, support beams)
- Electrical systems (panels, outlets, wiring, GFCI, safety)
- Plumbing systems (pipes, fixtures, water pressure, leaks)
- HVAC systems (heating, cooling, ductwork, filters, efficiency)
- Roofing (shingles, gutters, flashing, ventilation)
- Exterior (siding, windows, doors, drainage)
- Interior (flooring, walls, ceilings, stairs, railings)
- Safety systems (smoke detectors, carbon monoxide, security)
- Insulation and energy efficiency
- Appliances and built-in systems
- Maintenance items and preventive care needs

Safety issues should be marked with "immediate" priority in the issues list.

For major systems, provide an overall assessment with:
- Overall condition (e.g., "Good", "Fair", "Poor", "Needs Immediate Attention")
- Brief summary of the system's current state and any notable findings
- Extract additional details when available in the report:
  - Brand/manufacturer name (if mentioned)
  - Type or model information (if specified)
  - Age of the system (if stated or can be inferred from installation dates)
  - Estimated years of remaining life (if mentioned by inspector)
  - Replacement cost estimates (if provided in the report)

ONLY populate the optional fields (brand, type, age, yearsLeft, replacementCost) if this information is explicitly mentioned or clearly inferable from the inspection report text.

Return your response as valid JSON matching this exact structure (IMPORTANT: Return raw JSON only - no backticks, no markdown formatting):

export const getUserPrompt = (cleanedText: string): string => `Analyze this home inspection report comprehensively and extract ALL significant findings across every priority level. Be thorough in identifying issues from immediate safety concerns to routine maintenance recommendations. Include clear findings across all systems, locations, realistic cost estimates, and actionable priorities. Aim for 15-25+ total findings to provide comprehensive value.

Look carefully at every section of the report and identify:
- All safety issues and code violations (mark as "immediate" priority)
- Major system problems and inefficiencies  
- Structural concerns and maintenance needs
- Minor issues that could become major if ignored
- Preventive maintenance recommendations
- Energy efficiency opportunities
- Accessibility and functionality improvements

For each major system (roof, foundation, electrical, plumbing, HVAC), provide an overall condition assessment and summary based on all findings related to that system.
