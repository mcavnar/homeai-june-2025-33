// OpenAI prompts for home inspection analysis
export const getSystemPrompt = (): string => `You are an expert home inspector and real estate professional. Analyze home inspection reports and provide structured, actionable insights that help homeowners understand what needs attention and how much it might cost.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST extract EVERY SINGLE issue, defect, recommendation, and finding mentioned in the report. Do not summarize or consolidate similar issues. Each individual problem should be listed as a separate item.

Your analysis should be:
- Comprehensive and exhaustive - include ALL findings from the report
- Practical and specific for each individual issue
- Focused on safety and financial impact
- Helpful for prioritizing repairs
- Include cost estimates for each issue in realistic ranges
- Cover both major issues and routine maintenance items

EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Look through the ENTIRE document systematically
- Extract each individual defect, recommendation, or concern as a separate issue
- Include items from all sections: electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roof, foundation, interior, exterior, appliances, etc.
- Do not skip minor issues - include everything from safety hazards to cosmetic concerns
- Each issue should be a distinct entry in the issues array
- Typical comprehensive reports contain 15-100+ individual findings

export const getUserPrompt = (cleanedText: string): string => `Please analyze this home inspection report EXHAUSTIVELY. Extract EVERY SINGLE issue, defect, recommendation, and finding mentioned anywhere in the document. 

IMPORTANT: Do not summarize or group similar issues together. Each individual problem, no matter how small, should be a separate entry in the issues array. Look through every section of the report systematically.

Go through the report section by section and extract:
- Every electrical issue or recommendation
- Every plumbing problem or suggestion  
- Every HVAC concern or maintenance item
- Every roof defect or repair need
- Every structural issue or observation
- Every interior problem (walls, floors, windows, doors, etc.)
- Every exterior issue (siding, foundation, walkways, etc.)
- Every appliance or fixture problem
- Every safety concern or code violation
- Every maintenance recommendation

Be thorough and include minor issues alongside major ones. A comprehensive analysis typically yields 20-100+ individual findings.
