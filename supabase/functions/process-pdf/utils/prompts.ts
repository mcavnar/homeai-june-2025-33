export const getUserPrompt = (cleanedText: string): string => `Please analyze this home inspection report thoroughly and systematically. Extract all significant issues, defects, and actionable recommendations mentioned in the document. 

IMPORTANT: Do not summarize or group similar issues together. Each individual actionable problem should be a separate entry in the issues array. Look through every section of the report systematically.

Go through the report section by section and extract:
- All electrical issues, defects, or recommendations
- All plumbing problems, leaks, or maintenance needs  
- All HVAC concerns, defects, or service recommendations
- All roof problems, damage, or repair needs
- All structural issues, foundation concerns, or observations requiring attention
- All interior problems (walls, floors, windows, doors, etc.) that need repair or attention
- All exterior issues (siding, foundation, walkways, etc.) requiring maintenance or repair
- All appliance or fixture problems or recommendations
- All safety concerns, code violations, or hazards
- All maintenance recommendations that could prevent future problems

Focus on actionable items that require repair, replacement, monitoring, or maintenance. Include both immediate safety concerns and preventive maintenance recommendations. A thorough analysis typically yields 20-100+ actionable findings.
